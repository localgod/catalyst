# Why Convert?

## Flexibility and Collaboration

- **Textual vs. Visual:** PlantUML C4 format allows you to describe diagrams using text, which can be convenient for version control and collaboration. However, draw.io offers a more visual and interactive approach, making it easier to create complex diagrams.

- **Team Collaboration:** Converting PlantUML C4 diagrams to draw.io format can enhance team collaboration. Team members can work on diagrams using the user-friendly draw.io interface, even if they are not familiar with PlantUML syntax.

- **No Runtime Dependencies:** Unlike traditional PlantUML conversion, Catalyst requires no Java runtime or external executables, making it faster and easier to deploy.
