# Why Convert?

## Flexibility and Collaboration

- **Textual vs. Visual:** PlantUML allows you to describe diagrams using text, which can be convenient for version control and collaboration. However, draw.io offers a more visual and interactive approach, making it easier to create complex diagrams.

- **Team Collaboration:** Converting PlantUML diagrams to draw.io format can enhance team collaboration. Team members can work on diagrams using the user-friendly draw.io interface, even if they are not familiar with PlantUML.
