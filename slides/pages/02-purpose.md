# Purpose

## Bridging Standards

PlantUML C4 format and draw.io are widely used diagramming approaches, each with unique strengths. While PlantUML C4 format excels in creating architectural diagrams using textual descriptions, draw.io offers a more visual and intuitive diagramming experience. This project seeks to bridge the gap between these two approaches, allowing users to harness the power of both tools without requiring PlantUML runtime.

## Supporting C4 Modelling

The primary goal of this project is to support the [C4](https://c4model.com) modelling standard. C4 (Context, Containers, Components, and Code) is a popular architectural modeling approach for visualizing and documenting software architecture. By enabling the conversion of PlantUML C4 diagrams to draw.io, this tool facilitates the adoption of C4 modelling by providing a smooth transition from PlantUML's text-based format to draw.io's graphical capabilities.
