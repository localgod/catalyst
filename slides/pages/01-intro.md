# Overview

Catalyst is a software tool designed to facilitate the conversion of C4 diagrams written in [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) format into [draw.io](https://draw.io) C4 diagrams. While PlantUML itself is not required as a runtime dependency, the tool parses diagrams written in PlantUML's C4 syntax (.puml files). This project uses the Dagre layout engine for fast, pure JavaScript layout calculation without external dependencies.
